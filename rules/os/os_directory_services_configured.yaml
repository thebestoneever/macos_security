title: The macOS system must be integrated into a directory services infrastructure.
discussion: |
  Distinct user account databases on each separate system cause problems with username and password policy enforcement. Most approved directory services infrastructure solutions allow centralized management of users and passwords.
check: |
  If the system is using a mandatory Smart Card Policy, this is Not Applicable. 
  
  To determine if the system is integrated to a directory service, ask the System Administrator (SA) or Information System Security Officer (ISSO) or run the following command:
  
  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/dscl localhost -list . | /usr/bin/grep -vE "(Contact | Search | Local)"
  
  If nothing is returned, or if the system is not integrated into a directory service infrastructure, this is a finding.
fix: |
  Integrate the system into an existing directory services infrastructure.
